**Access**: When a user selects a Resource Record in the Resources Module, Access is the third tab on the record. This tab displays the Authentication Type, Access Method, Storage Location, Coverage, Username, Password, Simultaneous User Limit, Authorized Site(s), and Administering Site(s) pertaining to that particular title.

**Access Method**: In the Resources Module, the Access Method field accompanies the Authentication Type field. Field intended to indicate how/where resource is made available: External Host, Local Host, and Standalone CD. Users can view this information on a Resource Record under the Access tab.

**Accounts**: In the Organizations Module, the Accounts tab displays the External Login Type, URL, Login, and Password for access to the administrative side of an organization’s website. For example, a library might use this account information to access usage statistics.

In the Resources Module, Accounts is the sixth tab on a Resource Record and it displays any inherited organizations pertaining to that particular title, which might have special external logins or authentication. The tab also allows for account information specific to a certain resource but not necessarily its organizations.

**Acquisitions**: When a user selects a Resource Record in the Resources Module, Acquisitions is the second tab on the record. This tab displays the Acquisition Type, Initial Cost, and License Status pertaining to that particular title.

**Acquisition Type**: In the “Add New Resource” window, the Acquisition Type field is meant to distinguish among free, paid, and trial resources.

**Administering Site(s)**: In the Resources Module, the Administering Site field indicates what part of the library manages that particular resource. Options are customizable by the library. (Hekman Library uses “Main Library” and “Seminary.”) Users can view this information on a Resource Record under the Access tab.

**Alias**: An alias is a variant name for an organization (e.g. publisher) or resource (e.g. journal title). For example, Library of Congress or LOC.

**Alias Type**: In the Organizations Module, the Alias Type field allows users to specify what kind of variant name an organization uses as an alias. Values might include: Acronym, Alternate Name, and Name Change.

In the Resources Module, the Alias Type field allows users to specify what kind of variant name a resource might have as an alias. Values might include: Abbreviation, Alternate Name, and Name Change.

**Authentication Type**: In the Resources Module, the Authentication Type field indicates whether the resource requires a layer of security before a user may access it. Values might include: EZProxy, IP Address, Referring URL, and Username. Users can view this information on a Resource Record under the Access tab.

**Cataloging**: When a user selects a Resource Record in the Resources Module, Cataloging is the fourth tab on the record. This tab displays cataloging data and workflow information that could be added by a library’s periodicals catalogers. Information includes: Identifier, Source URL, Cataloging Type, Cataloging Status, # Records Available, # Records Loaded, and OCLC Holdings.

**Cataloging Type**: Newly added to the Resources Module, this field shows up on a Resource Record under the Cataloging tab and is intended to indicate the cataloging approach or source of catalog records used. Values might include: Batch, Manual, and MARCit.

**Child Organization**: An organization that is a branch of or is owned by a larger, parent organization. For example, Chadwyck-Healey is a child organization under the parent organization ProQuest.

**Child Resource**: A journal that is, perhaps, an offshoot of a larger publication, or “parent resource.” For example, a child resource could be a supplement or special issue that accompanies a regular publication.

In CORAL, parent and child resources are usually linked in the Resources Module.

**Contact**: A person at an organization, with whom a library may communicate regarding a journal title, agreement, license, etc. Users can add or update contacts in the Organizations Module, and the contacts will show up on any Resource Records that are associated with that Organization. Contacts can also be added directly to a Resource Record, but they will not link to the Organizations Module.

**Contact Role**: In the Organizations Module, the Contact Role field distinguishes between the different functions of contact people at an organization, with whom a library may need to communicate. Values might include: Accounting, Customer Support, Licensing, Sales, Tech Support, and Training.

**CORAL**: Centralized Online Resources Acquisitions and Licensing, an open source ERMS.

**ERMS**: Electronic Resources Management System.

**Expression Type**: In the Licensing Module, this field allows users to pull out significant clauses from a license agreement. For example, a library might want to list the license’s policy on interlibrary loan or the number of simultaneous users allowed in the database at one time. Values might include: Authorized Users, Confidentiality Clause, Coursepacks, eReserves, General Notes, Interlibrary Loan, Jurisdiction (Choice of Forum), Multi-Year Term, Post Cancellation Access (aka perpetual access), and Third-Party Archiving. Each option allows for additional notes depending on the item.

**External Login Type**: In the Organizations Module, users may enter additional information that might be important to the site administrator. For example, a library might want to enter the login and password for administering the account and generating usage statistics, which might be different from the login/password used for accessing the resource itself. Values might include: FTP, Other, Statistics, and Support.

Similarly in the Resources Module, users may enter additional information that might be important to the site administrator. For example, the Chronicle of Higher Education requires a login/password instead of IP authentication. Values might include FTP, Admin, Statistics, and Support.

**Format (field)**: In the “Add New Resource” window, the format field is meant to indicate the publication medium. Values might include: Electronic, Print, and Print + Electronic.

**ISBN**: International Standard Book Number, exclusive identification number for books and some monographs.

**ISSN**: International Standard Serial Number, exclusive identification number for periodicals and sometimes proceedings and monographs.

**Issues**: The Issues tab in the Organizations Module is meant to record general information about an organization that may be valuable over time with the original intention being to record information about access problems with the organization's offered resources or for breaches of the terms of use or license.

**License**: A legal document between a licensor and a library regarding access rights to a particular journal title, package of journals, or a research database. (Also called License Agreement.) Sometimes licenses are signed between a licensor and a consortium on behalf of its member libraries.

**License Status**: In the Resources Module, the License Status can be found in a Resource Record under the Acquisitions tab. License Status values might include: Completed, No License Required, and Pending. Once a resource is linked to a license, the user can go between the Resources Module and the Licensing Module to view details about the license.

In the Licensing Module, the License Status is a dropdown box when viewing an existing license agreement. Values might include: Awaiting Document, Complete, Document Only, Editing Expressions, and NLR (No License Required). Until a license is given a status, it will not show up as an option in the Resources Module Acquisitions tab. The license status in the resource module is intended to be a general status of whether the licensing work is in progress or completed. The license status in the Licensing Module is meant to indicate the status of the licensing process in greater detail.

**Licensing Module**: The CORAL Licensing Module provides a way for libraries to store and access digital copies of current and expired license agreements, as well as any related documents or associated agreement metadata.

**Note Type**: In the Resources Module, users may add customizable notes to Resource Records. The note type is intended to classify and group notes by their content. The note will appear on the Product tab. Values might include: Access Details, Acquisition Details, General, Licensing Details, and Product Details.

**Organization**: A general term referring to a publisher, provider, vendor, licenser, library, consortium, etc. – any group that relates to content purchased (or collected) by a library.

**Organization Record**: Page in the Organizations Module, which contains six tabs (Organization, Aliases, Contacts, Accounts, Issues, and Licenses) and displays key information about a particular organization.

**Organization Role**: An organization may have one or more than one function in relation to content: Archiving Agency, Consortium, Library, Platform, Provider, Publisher, School, or Vendor. This information is displayed within a Resource Record’s Product tab.

**Organizations Module**: The CORAL Organizations Module provides a way for libraries to store and manage names, contacts, and account information for the many publishers, providers, vendors, etc. that they interact with on a daily basis.

**Parent Organization**: A large organization that may have many branches, subsidiaries, or “child organizations” affiliated with it. In CORAL, parent and children organizations are usually linked in the Organizations Module and the Resources Module. For example, ProQuest is a parent organization to many other organizations, including Chadwyck-Healey.

**Parent Resource**: A resource that has identifiable subordinate parts. For example a package resource record would be a parent of an individual journal resource record.

**Product**: The Product tab is one of seven tabs that make up a Resource Record. It contains descriptive information for identifying a particular resource, including Journal Title, Record ID, ISSN/ISBN, Organizations, Publisher, and Resource URL.

**Record ID**: A Record ID is the unique number assigned to a particular Resource in CORAL. Record IDs are assigned automatically in the order in which they are added to CORAL and remain exclusive to the library’s system. That is, Record IDs will differ by the institution because of the order in which they were added.

**Resource**: A resource is usually a single publication (journal, book title, etc.), such as Booklist, or a package of titles that a library wants to manage as a single unit. Each resource will have a Resource Record page containing seven tabs (Product, Acquisitions, Access, Contacts, Attachments, and Routing).

**Resource Record**: Page in the CORAL Resources Module, which contains seven tabs (Product, Acquisitions, Access, Contacts, Attachments, and Routing) and displays key information about a particular resource.

**Resources Module**: The CORAL Resources Module aids in the management of the electronic resource workflow from the initial request through the acquisition process and into ongoing support and maintenance.

**Resource Type**: In the “Add New Resource” window, the resource type field is optional, but provides additional context and is customizable through the admin page. Values might include: eBooks, Multi-media, periodicals, Reference, and Research Databases.

**Terms**: Refers to the conditions of a licensing agreement, which a library might have with an organization regarding a particular journal title.

**Terms Tool**: An add-on to the CORAL Licensing Module, the Terms Tool enables key stakeholders, such as interlibrary loan staff, to view the license terms without needing direct access to CORAL Licensing. The tool allows authorized users to retrieve license terms for a specific resource based on an ISSN or ISBN query.

More specifically, the Terms Tool uses ISBNs and ISSNs to query SFX (or another openURL resolver) and subsequently retrieve a list of available providers. Then, the Terms Tool queries CORAL Licensing for the license terms for each provider.
